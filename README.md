# The Egoless Web

## Web 2.0: The Ego Web

The modern web, especially social media, is a realm rampant with Likes,
Favourites, Stars, and Followers. A number for every human interaction.

Everywhere you look, your rich multidimensional human-to-human interactions are
being condensed into numbers and sold back to you in the form of instant
gratification.

We become addicted to making our numbers bigger than everybody else's numbers,
and get lost in comparing our numbers to our friends' numbers over and over
again. These numbers feed our egos; they make them bigger and stronger over and
over again. Other people become noise to our ego's endless appetite.

## A Web of People

What would happen if the numbers were removed? What if the focus of all human
interaction became centred on the actual people involved and the things they had
to say to each other? What if we were all equals on the internet, without
a numberic value to tell us who is more important or more "successful"?

This is the goal of _The Egoless Web_. Today, this takes the form of a Chrome
browser extension that defines CSS rules to remove gamification numbers from
popular websites.

`egoless-web` is an open source project, meaning anyone can contribute new CSS
rules to strip ego numbers from sites they otherwise like and use.

## Installation

Until this is a proper Chrome extension in the "Chrome Store", you'll need to
perform a few manual steps:

1. clone this git repo somewhere (`git clone
   https://github.com/RichardLitt/egoless-web`)
2. open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. click on `Developer Mode`
4. click on `Load unpacked extension..`
5. select the `egoless-web` folder
